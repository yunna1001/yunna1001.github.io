  abstract = {Industrial park is an important emission sector of PM2.5 pollution. Previous studies have provided valuable information on the impact of PM2.5 from industrial parks on human health, but relevant studies at city scale are limited. In this study, the health burden of industrial parks was evaluated based on PM2.5-related premature deaths and economic contributions. The premature deaths were calculated in terms of a novel research model by integrating the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) model, weighted concentration-weighted trajectory (WCWT), and integrated exposure-response function (IER). Take Tianjin City for example, it was found that since the main diffusion direction of PM2.5 in Tianjin is from south to north, the industrial parks in the south of Tianjin and close to the central city with high population density have high health burden. These industrial parks need to be focused on or even relocated in the future. The research model can provide scientific basis for the health burden evaluation of industrial parks at city scale, so as to help local governments optimize the layout of industrial parks and formulate environmental responsibility management policies for industrial parks.}
